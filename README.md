# Add-First-Last-Name
Another handy PHP snippet is this one, which inserts the Billing First Name and Billing Last Name to the WooCommerce My Account pageâ€™s Registration Form.  This is a fantastic start. You may then add any custom input field to the form, such as dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes, and link them to the relevant WooCommerce user fields.
